How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	I can save my time by identifying errors quickly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

	automatic commits may not make sense, whereas we can assume that manual commits would be usable.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	This depends on each version-controller's development base. Google Docs might not consider files to be connected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git Log andhelps me out by checking the various commits stored. Git diff helps to differentiate teasily between 2 different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	I can easily revert back to an earlier version, and this makes me more confident.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Making a mobile app for my startup.
